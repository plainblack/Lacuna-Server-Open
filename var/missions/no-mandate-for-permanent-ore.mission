This is Sulanti of the Grizellan Confederacy.  Do you have any colony ships available?  I know it seems a lot to ask, but we are literally drowning in ore... Well, okay, not literally, but you understand.  We need to expand, get to some new land. We're having a hard time generating enough food and water for our own people, let alone a colony ship! I'll gladly trade you one of our mining platform ships in exchange for a colony ship, provided you can also supply 10,000 units each of algae and water to sustain us. Then, maybe we can establish a nice, peaceful farming colony.  In fact, I think I'm going to move there.","mission_objective":{"resources":{"algae":10000,"water":10000},"ships":[{"stealth":0,"type":"colony_ship","hold_size":0,"speed":0}]},"max_university_level":"25","name":"No Mandate for Permanent Ore","mission_reward":{"ships":[{"stealth":3,"type":"mining_platform_ship","hold_size":0,"speed":690}]},"mission_type":"trade"}
