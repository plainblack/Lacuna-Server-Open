We have been fortunate in the past to trade for small amounts of water to stave off thirst on our arid planet. However, we are tired of making small trades to get what we need. We need a supply of water that will last us for generations. We have been fortunate to have a planet with a natural supply of the rare mineral Essentia. We have mined the last of it and are willing to trade our entire supply of Esssentia for enough water that we never have to worry about water again."}
