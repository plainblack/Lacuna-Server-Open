Aparently, people like this realism thing.  My next project is to give 'em a bit of action, and nothing says 'action' like a good aerial battle.  What I need for this picture are fighters.  Seven of them.  Old ones would be best, in order to ensure a rustic feel, but anything that flies will do.\nIn exchange, my company will really help your people out.  Instead of just upgrading your entertainment district, we'll build you a whole new complex!  You will also get a tiny share of the profits, in Essentia.","mission_type":"trade","mission_objective":{"ships":[{"stealth":4,"speed":1,"hold_size":0,"type":"fighter"},{"stealth":4,"speed":1,"hold_size":0,"type":"fighter"},{"stealth":4,"speed":1,"hold_size":0,"type":"fighter"},{"stealth":4,"speed":1,"hold_size":0,"type":"fighter"},{"stealth":4,"speed":1,"hold_size":0,"type":"fighter"},{"stealth":4,"speed":1,"hold_size":0,"type":"fighter"},{"stealth":4,"speed":1,"hold_size":0,"type":"fighter"}]},"max_university_level":"20","name":"The Big Picture pt 2"}
