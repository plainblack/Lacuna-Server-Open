{"network_19_headline":"q infestation on Lukram 4 reaches epidemic proportions.","network_19_completion":"The government of Lukram 4 acknowledges %s's aid in controlling the beedleban population.","description":"Greetings from Lukram 4.  This year a strange mutation in our beedleban population has caused them to multiply beyond our control, overrunning our ranches.  They quickly consumed all of the Denton Root available on our planet, and have now moved on to other less-desirable foods, putting us at the brink of an agricultural collapse.  The most expedient way to deal with the outbreak is through the use of a specially-developed genetic inhibitor drug qhich requires a large amount of flourite to produce.  We will then also need an import of Denton Root to use as bait so that the beedleban will ingest thr presticides.  If you can provide 20,000 each of root and flourite, we will happily exchange this for 25,000 each of energy and water.","mission_objective":{"resources":{"fluorite":20000,"root":20000}},"max_university_level":"20","name":"Infestation","mission_reward":{"resources":{"energy":25000,"water":25000}},"mission_type":"trade"}
