Look, I've messed up badly and I need a little help.  I used some of the professor's excavators to search for a glyph she needs for her research, but it turns out I had my coordinates confused.  Now I've got the wrong glyph, and I'm missing several excavators!  If you could send me 5 new excavators, I can give you this glyph I obtained.  It's useless to Dr. Unlat for her research, and if she finds out I wasted an excavator obtaining it, she will be furious.  I'll probably be expunged.  Huh?  No, not expelled, expunged.  If I don't graduate, I'll literally be put to death.  Why, what do you do with people who don't finish graduate school in your society?","max_university_level":"15"}
