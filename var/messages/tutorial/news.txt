Bad News
~~~
I think Tou Re Ell is on to me, so this will have to be our last communication for a while. Don't worry, I'll be back. 

While I'm gone get yourself a Network 19 Affiliate. Network 19 is outside the jurisdiction of Lacuna Expanse Corp, so you'll be able to get clean uncensored news from them, and Tou Re Ell won't be able to do anything about it. This will probably be your first look into the region of space around you. Use the information you gather wisely.

I'll see if I can get you some resources to help you build it. Unfortunately the resources might not make it to you until you've already built it. Oh well, they'll be just as good for your next build. By the way Network 19 uses a lot of energy so you may need to upgrade an energy plant before you build it; and you'll likely also need to upgrade your University.

Regards,

Not Tou Re Ell (2+2=3 and Pi is for eating)
