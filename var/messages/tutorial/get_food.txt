You Need Food
~~~
I am delighted that you've chosen to use my vast knowledge of the Expanse to your advantage. As I promised, I will begin your training by introducing you to the most vital component to your growth and survival: resources.  

Resources are the key to expanding your empire. Without them, your species will perish. The most vital of all the resources is food. You'll want to gather more food right away. Not every planet has the right climate to create every type of food so you'll have to use what's available to you.  

As a token of our lasting friendship, Lacuna Expanse Corp has sent emissaries to your world to build a free Malcud Fungus Farm for your people. This particular source of food is one of our favorites as it is cheap to build and does not promote waste. Don't worry if you already have one of these, you can always benefit from more of them.

To build, click or tap the build icon {build} in an empty space on your planet surface map. Then choose the Malcud Fungus Farm from the available list.

Regards,

Tou Re Ell
Lacuna Expanse Corp
