Don't Be So Naive
~~~
You are a trusting fool. You realize you've climbed into bed with Tralk's Demon by doing things for and taking gifts from Tou Re Ell? His one allegiance is to Lacuna Expanse Corp, not you. You don't know me and I'm going to keep it that way, but I've been monitoring your progress as well. Tou Re Ell really needs to change his password once in a while, but I digress.  

If you're ever going to stand up against Lacuna Expanse Corp you'll need some help from someone other than them. You realize what they're after, right? They've told you why they keep giving you all these gifts? I didn't think so! They want the rare mineral called Essentia {essentia}. Our entire economy, our empire, relies on it to survive. Tou Re Ell figures the little bit of time and energy he spends with you now means you'll sell him all the Essentia you happen upon. Or worse yet, you'll do all the exploring and then he'll just swoop in and take it from you when you discover a nice deposit.  

You've got a nice start to your infrastructure, but you really need to start building it up a bit. Without a steady production of your basic resources your empire's growth will slow to a crawl. Build up your food {food} income so that it's at least %s per hour. One way you can do this is to build more farms. However, now that you have a University you could also upgrade your existing farms. To upgrade a building click or tap on the building, and then click or tap on the *upgrade* button.

I'm not against gifts to forward my cause, and it certainly appears you're not against receiving them to forward your empire, so I'll have a present waiting for you *if* you can complete this task.

Regards,

Not Tou Re Ell (or at least his stolen email account)
Lacuna Expanse Corp

Task: Build to %s food per hour.
Reward: A mystery present.
