Counter Spies
~~~
Well done. I've been able to get you the plans to upgrade your Intelligence Ministry to level two and I've trained one of your spies personally. That should help keep some of your information and resources protected. You should train another spy so you have two. Then set one on Capture Spies duty and one on Gather Intelligence. The more the merrier when it comes to keeping the bad guys out.

I'm unsure how much longer I can keep helping you. Unfortunately, I believe they are wise to me, and with each message I send, they get closer to discovering my identity. Be careful. Trust no one.
