Counter Spies
~~~
Well done. I've been able to get you the plans to upgrade your Intelligence Ministry to level two and I've trained one of your spies personally. That should help keep some of your information and resources protected. You should train another spy in your Intelligence Ministry, so you have two. Then set them both on Counter Espionage. Counter Espionage is a defensive assignment, most other assignments are offensive, and should be used when you put your spies on enemy planets.

I'm unsure how much longer I can keep helping you. Unfortunately, I believe they are wise to me, and with each message I send, they get closer to discovering my identity. Be careful. Trust no one.
