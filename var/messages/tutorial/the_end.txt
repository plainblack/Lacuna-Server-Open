The End
~~~
Unfortunately, our journey has come to an end. As our final gift, we've shipped you a Subspace Transporter. All you need to do is set it up. The Subspace Transporter allows you to transport resources instantly to anyone else that has one. Unfortunately, this process consumes a tiny amount of Essentia {essentia}. It's a shame to waste it, but the speed of transport has no parallel.

We would like very much to be your first trading partner. We have a nearly infinite amount of resources at our disposal, but very little Essentia. If you're willing to part with some Essentia when you come across it, we'll trade with you for any goods that you need. This will be our exclusive deal with you. Keep in mind all the help we've given you to get started. With this in mind, I believe, I hope, that you will consider trading with us whenever you are in need.

As a show of good faith, I've restocked your storage a bit. You'll find I've topped off your storage with 2000 of each resource.

Your Trading Partner,

Tou Re Ell
Lacuna Expanse Corp
