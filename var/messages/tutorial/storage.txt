Need More Storage
~~~
You've done well to this point. It's important to understand a bit more about resources and storage now that your production is ramping up. We wouldn't want your recent efforts to be in vain during these crucial stages of development.

Click or tap your Planetary Command Center and look at the Planet details. You should see how many of each resource type you are currently capable of storing. Now compare that to the number of resources you have and the rate at which you gather new resources. It should be clear that you will fill up your storage if you do not increase it. Once you have filled the available storage for any resource, additional resources collected will be lost forever so it is vital that you manage this properly.

In order to prevent resource loss, build Ore Storage Tanks, a Food Reserve, an Energy Reserve, and Water Storage Tanks.
