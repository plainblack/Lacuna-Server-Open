You're A Pawn!
~~~
Couldn't Tou Re Ell pick a more original password than his pet Beeldeban's name? Don't answer that. I have a more pressing question for you:

Do you command your own empire or are you just Tou Re Ell's pawn? You're playing with fire you know. I guess it's up to you, but I can help you so that you don't have worry about him or his overlords at Lacuna Expanse Corp. You'll need to build something first. The Intelligence Ministry will be almost as important as your resources. Without it other empires will be able to steal your hard earned resources and technologies, and who knows what else!

I'd hate to see you fall prey to further advances from Tou Re Ell.

Regards,

Not Tou Re Ell (I wonder if he was called "towel" when he was a child?)
Lacuna Expanse Corp

Task: Build the Intelligence Ministry.
Reward: A free upgrade for the Intelligence Ministry, plus a spy.
