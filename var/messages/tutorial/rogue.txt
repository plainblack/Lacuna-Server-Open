Rogue Agent
~~~
It seems you've been busy. We realize you've been cooperating with someone else in our organization; a rogue agent. This is a tricky business you've gotten yourself in to. No matter, we'll have that little problem dealt with soon enough. 

In the meantime you've done a nice job continuing to build your empire. You'll soon be in contact with other empires in the Expanse. You should make sure that they know who you are and what you stand for. Describe your empire in the Description field of your profile so other empires know what they can expect from you. Also feel free to update your status if you want to keep everyone up to date with what you're up to.

Regards,

Tou Re Ell
