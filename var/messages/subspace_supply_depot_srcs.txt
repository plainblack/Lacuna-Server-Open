Special Delivery
~~~
%s just took delivery of that thing you ordered. Sorry you weren't there to sign for it, but I just dropped it off at the Space Port. I figured that's where you'd want the thing. Anyways, the thing is that Joey, you know "Joey the Nose" down at the docks, yeah Joey, well he promised me a little something extra for delivering this one fast-like. Only he wasn't there. So if you wouldn't mind, next time I'm coming in, if you could leave a little something extra for me down at the docks, I'd really appreciate it. Anyways, enjoy your thing.
