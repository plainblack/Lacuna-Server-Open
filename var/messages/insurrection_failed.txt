Insurrection Failed
~~~
We have failed in our attempt to take control of {Starmap %s %s %s}, but not for lack of trying. It seems that the people are simply not as dissatisfied with their government as we thought. We can work on that by inciting a rebellion.
We currently have them at %s unhappiness and with our chances based off of %s giving us a %s%% chance of taking control.

Regards,
