Step 1: Prereqs

First you need to have all the prereqs installed. If you're on a CentOS / RHEL environment you can do the following:

cd bin/setup/server
./download.sh
./build.sh
cd ..
./installpms.sh

If not, then you'll need to tear apart those scripts and do what they do.



Step 2: Start Storage

You need to start up you MySQL server and memcached. Memcached is as easy as:

memcached -d

MySQL will depend on the system and how you installed it.



Step 3: Config Files

You'll need to create lacuna.conf, nginx.conf, and log.conf in your Lacuna-Server/etc folder. Start with the example files provided in the root of this repository.



Step 4: Initialize Database

Log into mysql and create a database:

mysql -uroot -pyourrootpassword

create database lacuna;
grant all privileges on lacuna.* to lacuna@localhost identified by 'somepassword';
flush privileges;
exit;

cd bin/setup
perl init_lacuna.pl
perl generate_captcha.pl


Step 5: Start The Server

To start the lacuna server just type:

cd bin
./startdev.sh

Now in another terminal you can start issuing commands to the server.



Step 6: Missions (optional)

If you want to be able to do anything with missions, you'll need to check out the Lacuna-Mission repository into
/data/Lacuna-Mission
