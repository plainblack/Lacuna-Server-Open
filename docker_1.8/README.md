## Docker 1.8

Check what version of docker you are using. At the time of writing this the latest
version of docker running on Fedora/Centos is 1.8 (if installed using yum or dnf).

There are differences in using a network between these two versions.

If you are running docker 1.8 then use the commands in this directory.

If you are using docker 1.9 or above then use the commands in the ./docker
directory.
