Current status of fleet-action code in the API

Shipyard:
 - I am fairly sure that all APIs for the shipyard are complete

Spaceport:
 - All API calls to the Spaceport are working and at least return something sensible
 - look at 460_fleet_spaceport.t for example calls to the API
 - there are a few minor issues, but these will be easier to test once the UI is working
