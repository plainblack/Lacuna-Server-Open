my $message = q{As it is approaching what your Species calls 'Christmas' it seems that it is now traditional to send gifts to each other at this time.

In order to foster good will between all species we have taken the liberty of sending you two plans for Sub Space Depots, a plan for a sculpture, and increased your boost time by one of your traditional months.

How you use the the plans is up to you. You may use them yourselves, perhaps on one of your new colonies. Some of the more mature species may decide that at your level of technology you have little use for them yourselves, in which case you may wish to extend the hand/tenticle/pseudopod (delete as appropriate) of friendship and share them with some of the less developed empires.

In any case, we wish you well for your next solar orbital period.

Your Trading Partner,

Tou Re Ell
