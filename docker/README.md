## A quick start to running Lacuna Expanse Server in Docker

Docker is a quick and easy way (well, compared to trying to build a server from 
scratch!) of getting a development system up and running so you can experiment
and modify the Lacuna Expanse server code.

Please read the documents at ![Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
for your specific system.

(There are a few additional notes below based on our experience of installing Docker)

### Installing on OS X.

On OS X Docker runs in a Virtual Box, the default base memory is 1024 MB but
it might be too little, in which case you need to set higher, say 8196 as 
follows. (Note this will blow-away your current docker containers if you have
any!)

    $ docker-machine rm default
    $ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 8096 default
    $ eval "$(docker-machine env default)"

## Setting up your dev environment

You need to checkout the code from github into a local directory as normal, I
will assume you are checking out to 

    ~/Lacuna-Server-Open
    ~/Lacuna-Web-Client

You need to create some config files for the docker config,

    $ cd ~/Lacuna-Server-Open/etc
    $ cp lacuna.conf.docker lacuna.conf
    $ cp log4perl.conf.docker log4perl.conf
    $ cp nginx.conf.docker nginx.conf

It is unlikely that you will need to change these config files from their
defaults.

### Starting up the docker containers.

In Lacuna-Server-Open there is a sub-directory 'docker' (where you are now!)

Setting up a server is as simple as running the following scripts, in this
order

    $ ./create_tle_data.sh
    $ ./run_tle_beanstalk.sh
    $ ./run_tle_memcached.sh
    $ ./run_tle_mysql_server.sh
    $ ./run_tle_server.sh (leave this running in a terminal mession for now, otherwise nginx will not work!)
    $ ./run_tle_nginx.sh

If this has worked, you can now do the following to see what is running.

    $ docker ps -a

This should show you have several docker containers running (i.e. Status
of 'Up xx minutes').

These containers are fairly self-explanitory.

### tle-beanstalk

This runs the beanstalk message queue. It is a standard Docker container.

### tle-memcached

Again a standard Docker container with default ports.

### tle-mysql-server

This is a standard Docker MySql server. You can also connect to this
container to run a mysql client to inspect and modify your database.

### tle-mysql-data

This is a container, but it is data-only. It is never run. This allows you
to have a persistent database for mysql. You can start/stop other containers
but your mysql data will remain.

If you ever want to 'blow-away' your database and start again then you
should first stop and remove all containers that refer to it (tle-mysql)
and then do the following.

    $ docker rm -v tle-mysql-data
    $ ./create_tle_data.sh

### tle-nginx

This is your web server which exposes the docker port to the outside world.
By default this will run the web server on localhost port 8080 (but this can
be configured).

### tle-server

This is the Server Code. You can start and restart your development server
from within this container. This will put you into the Docker container in the 
bash shell. Normally you will just run the command

    $ ./startdev

But there are a few things you need to do first (see below, Initial Configuration).


## Initial configuration

There are a few things you need to do to set up your development system.

If you have just created your tle-mysql-data container then it will be empty.

The first time you run up the tle-server you need to run a few commands.

    $ cd /data/lacuna-server/bin
    $ mysql --host=tle-mysql-server -uroot -placuna
    mysql> source docker.sql
    mysql> exit

This sets up the user account 'lacuna' which is used by the web application.

(Note that the root account has been given the password 'lacuna').

You now need to initialize the database. (this will take a few minutes).

    $ cd ~/Lacuna-Server-Open/bin/setup
    $ perl init_lacuna.pl


We don't really need captchas in development. Run this script to create
captchas all with a result of '1'.

    $ perl generate_captcha_docker.pl


You will want to generate the html version of the documentation so you
can view it in your web browser.

    $ cd ~/Lacuna-Server-Open/bin
    $ perl generate_docs.pl


## Running schedulers

There are some processes which run as daemons on the server, these control
the arrival of ships or the completion of a building upgrade. These take
their jobs off the beanstalk queue at the time when the task is to be
completed.

Normally you would run these as a daemon as follows.

    $ perl schedule_building.pl --noquiet
    $ perl schedule_ship_arrival.pl --noquiet

The --noquiet argument ensures that their actions are logged into log files
which you can choose to tail in another terminal session.

    /tmp/schedule_building.log
    /tmp/schedule_ship_arrival.log

## Running the server (finally!)

You can now run the development server

    $ ./startdev.sh

This will run in the current terminal session, type ctrl-c to terminate
the server at any time. type 'exit' to exit the docker container and return
to the host and close the container.

If you make changes to the server code (in the host environment) you will need
to do so from a separate terminal session and then restart the server in this
terminal session.
