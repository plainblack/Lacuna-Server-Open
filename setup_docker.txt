Introduction
============

Docker documentation can be found at:-

  https://docs.docker.com

Docker works with 'containers' which you can think of as lightweight
virtual machines. They can be built once, and deployed in many places.

A docker image has been created to allow the Lacuna Expanse Server to
be run from linux, in OS-X or in Windows.

By comparison, if you were to set up a Lacuna Expanse Server, you would
need to do so either on a Linux server, or a virtual machine running
Centos. You would need to install all the packages, including building
Perl and loading all the support libraries and CPAN modules. From
experience thes can take up to 16 hours to do and to resolve any issues.

By comparison you can download the docker image (perhaps 10 to 20
minutes) and run up the server in just a few seconds in Docker.


Install Docker
==============

Installation on various systems can be found at

  https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

Please check the requirements. In particular on Windows you need to
ensure that your PC supports virtualization technology and that it
is enabled in the BIOS.


Special considerations for OS X
-------------------------------

Docker cannot run natively on OS X so it runs in VirtualBox.

By default, the 'default' image created has a base memory of 1024 MB.

You should delete the image created during the installation process and
recreate it with a base memory of 8192 MB.

  docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox_memory 8192 default


Creating the Docker Images
==========================

The git repository, Lacuna-Server-Open includes a Dockerfile and a number
of scripts which can be used to create the image.


Create a data-only container for mysql
--------------------------------------

Normally when you stop or close a container any data within it will be
destroyed. However by using a separate data-only container it is possible
to keep the data even if you stop/kill/rebuild any container using it.

  docker create --name tle-mysql-data arungupta/mysql-data-container

This will create the data container to which the web application will 
connect when it is run. This will be used by mysql to maintain the database.

If you ever have a need to refresh the database then you can delete this
image and recreate it.


To build the application image from scratch
-------------------------------------------

You don't need to build an image yourself, you can download and run the
pre-built image (see below). You may only need to do this if you want to
make changes to the server setup (note, you don't need to do this if you
are just changing the source code).

  ./docker_build.sh

This will load the base image (Centos) and automatically do all the steps to
load and build the web server software. Note, this code will download some
libraries (such a memcache) and it is possible that it will fail due to a
change in the version number of these packages. (This is the same issue you
may have if you build it manually.) The whole process will take a couple of
hours (depending on your download speed).

Once you have built it you can run the image as follows.

  ./docker_run.sh

The server will start and put you in the command prompt almost instantly.


To download and run the pre-built image
---------------------------------------

This is the preferred approach, the image has been built already, all you
need to do is download it and run it from docker-hub. The download takes
about 20 minutes (depending upon network speed).

  ./docker_run_prebuilt.sh

Once downloaded, it remains cached locally so that you don't need to download
it again.


Initializing the database
=========================

You can connect to the running server (see above) with another bash session.

  ./docker_exec.sh

This will put you in the bin directory.

The first time you run your image there will be no database and so you should
run the following scripts

  $ mysql
  mysql> source docker.sql
  mysql> exit
  $ cd setup
  $ perl init_lacuna.pl
  $ perl generate_captcha.pl

The two perl scripts will take a while to complete (20 minutes?) but once
completed your web server should be ready to go. 

The database is preserved in the data only container you created earlier.


Making code changes to the TLE application
==========================================

The container running the web application is mapping the directories
'lib','bin','etc' and 'var' from the host. This means that you can make
changes to those files using your normal host environment/editors etc.
You can also use git commands to change branches, commit etc. in you host. 
There should be no need to edit files from within your docker container.

However, as normal, if you change your code you will need to restart your
web server (that should still be running in your session where you did the
'./docker_run.sh' command. (ctrl-c, $ ./startdev.sh).

(It is a common mistake to change your code, and forget to restart your
server and wonder why your changes are not working!)

If you *do* need to make changes in your container (for example to 
do SQL queries) then you can use the './docker_exec.sh' script to open 
another session.
