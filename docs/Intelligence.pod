=head1 Intelligence Methods

Intelligence Ministry is accessible via the URL C</intelligence>.

The Intelligence Ministry is where you build and control your spies.

The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.

=head2 view ( session_id, building_id )

 {
    "status" : { ... },
    "building" : { ... },
    "spies" : {
        "maximum" : 5,
        "current" : 1,
        "in_training" : 1,
        "training_costs" : {
            "food" : 100,
            "water" : 120,
            "energy" : 20,
            "ore" : 5,
            "waste" : 10,
            "time" : 60,
        }
    },
 }
 

=head2 train_spy ( session_id, building_id, [ quantity ])

Allows you to train more spies.

 {
    "status" : { ... },

    "reason_not_trained" : {
        "code" : 1011,
        "message" : "Not enough food to train a spy.",
    },
 }
 
The only reason C<not_trained> might be over 0 is if you specify training more spies than you have resources to spend in which case the reason_not_trained block will be included.

Throws 1013, 1009.

                "y" : -71
            },
            "is_available" : 1, # can be reassigned
            "available_on" : "01 31 2010 13:09:05 +0600", # if can't be reassigned, this is when will be available
            "started_assignment" : "01 31 2010 13:09:05 +0600",
            "seconds_remaining" : 45,
			"mission_count" : {

				"defensive" : 149
			}
        },
        ...
    ],
    "spy_count" : 12
 }

The mission block allows you to give immediate feedback to the player. The C<result> types that can be sent back are:

=over

=item Accepted

This is provided when no immediate mission occurs. For example, if you set a spy to "Idle" or "Counter Espionage".

=item Success

This means a mission has occurred and came out in favor of the spy.

=item Bounce

This means a mission started, but was foiled and neither side won.

=item Failure

This means a mission occurred, but went so poorly that the defense got the upper hand and bested you.

=back

The C<reason> provides a message in sentence form about why a spy won or lost a mission. This message is related to the success or failure, not any outcome that results from that success or failure.

The C<message_id> refers to a message in the L<Inbox>. Providing this ID allows you to pop open the inbox to a specific message to display to the user. The message will tell you what the outcome of the mission is if any. Not all missions will provide a message_id.
