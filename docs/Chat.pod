=head1 Chat

The chat system is overlayed onto the web client in a way that makes it impossible for other apps to use it. 
However, through this API you can pop open a web browser from your app that will allow the users to participate 
in the conversation.

B<NOTE:> This API is B<not> JSON-RPC based.

To open a chat, open a browser window / panel / pane and point it to:

 http://servername.lacunaexpanse.com/chat?session_id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

The chat system will handle the rest.

B<NOTE:> The parameters in the above URL can be passed via GET or POST, it doesn't matter which.
