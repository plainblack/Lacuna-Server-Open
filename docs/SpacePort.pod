=head1 Space Port Methods

Space Port is accessible via the URL C</spaceport>.

The Space Port is where all the ships you build will be docked once they have been built from the L<Shipyard>.
You can dock twice as many ships as the level of the Space Port.

The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.

=head2 target

Some of the Space Port methods allow ships to be sent to targets. This parameter is described here.

A hash reference that can contain one of five items to identify a star or body.

 { "body_name" : "Earth" }
 
 { "body_id" : "id-goes-here" }
 
 { "star_name" : "Sol" }
 
 { "star_id" : "id-goes-here" }
 
 { "x" : 4, "y" : -3 }

=head4 body_name

A string with the body's name. Case insensitive, but will throw an exception for misspelling.

=head4 body_id

The unique id of the body.

=head4 star_name

A string with the star's name. Case insensitive, but will throw an exception for misspelling.

=head4 star_id

The unique id of the star.

=head4 x | y

A set of x,y coordinates to locate the star or body.

=head2 paging

Some of the Space Port methods allow the results to be paged. This parameter is described here.

If no paging options are selected, then it defaults to 25 items_per_page and page_number 1

=head3 paging

Optional. A hash reference that contains the paging criteria. Valid paging option keys include page_number, items_per page and no_paging.

=head4 page_number

Optional. An integer representing the page of ships to return. Defaults to 1.

=head4 items_per_page

Optional. An integer representing the number of items per page to return. Defaults to 25.

=head4 no_paging

Optional. If set to 1, all other paging options are ignored and all results will be retured.

  { "no_paging" : 1 }

  { "page_number" : 2, "items_per_page" : 30 }

=head2 filter

Some of the SpacePort methods allow the fleets to be filtered. This parameter is described here.

If no filter option is selected, then it defaults to returning all entries.

=head3 filter

Optional: A hash reference that contains the filter criteria. 
Valid filter option keys include task, type and tag.

=head3 task

Optional. An array reference or string with the task(s) to filter on. Valid tasks include Docked, Building,
Mining, Travelling, Defend, Orbiting, 'Waiting On Trade', 'Supply Chain' and 'Waste Chain'.

=head3 type

Optional. An array reference or string with the type(s) to filter on. Valid types are the existing ship types.

=head3 tag

Optional. An array reference or string with the tag(s) to filter on. Valid tags include Trade, Colonization,
Intelligence, Exploration, War, Mining, SupplyChain WasteChain.

Note: Tags will be converted to types prior to filtering and any types that were passed will be replaced.

 { "task" : "Defend" }

 { "tag" : "Mining" }

 { "task" : "Docked", "type" : "freighter" }

 { "tag" : [ "Colonization", "Exploration" ], "task" : "Travelling" }

=head2 sort

Some of the SpacePort methods allow the list of fleets to be sorted.

Optional. A string with the column to sort on. Defaults to 'type'. 

Valid columns to sort on are combat, name, speed, stealth, task and type.

A second sort colomn, 'name', is added to your chosen sort column (unless it happened to also be 'name')

The B<number_of_fleets> is the total number of fleets. (Not all fleets will be
seen in the B<incoming> section if paging is in effect).

B<owner> in the B<from> section specifies either 'Own', 'Allied" or "Foreign" depending upon
who the fleet is from.

The B<from> and B<to> sections will only be displayed for ships that are travelling, orbiting or defending.

You will only see fleets from 'foreign' empires if the target is either your own or an allies planet, and then
the fleet information will be filtered depending upon the highest level of Spaceport on the target.

To see the C<from> block :-

 SpacePort Level * 450 >= Fleet Stealth

To see the C<details> block  :-

 SpacePort level * 350 >= Fleet Stealth

Note that you will always see full info for your own, or allied incoming fleets.

=head2 send_fleet

Send a fleet of ships to a specified target body.

Accepts either fixed arguments or a hash of named parameters

 ( session_id, fleet_id, quantity, target, arrival_date )
 ( parameter_hash )
  
=head3 session_id (required)
  
A session ID
  
=head3 fleet_id (required)

The ID of the fleet to send

=head3 quantity (required)

The number of ships in the fleet to send

=head3 target (required)
  
The target body to check.

=head3 arrival_date (optional)

A hash ref giving the arrival date/time
  {
    "soonest" : "1",
  }

  or

  {
    "month" : "08",
    "date" : "13",
    "hour" : "01",
    "minute" : "59",
    "second" : "45",
  }

The earliest arrival time is determined by the fleet's maximum speed,
to specify this use the B<soonest> option.

If B<arrival_date> is not specified then it defaults to B<soonest>.

Otherwise specify the month/day/hour/minute/second for the fleet to
arrive. You cannot specify an arrival date sooner than the earliest
arrival time.

Note that the estimated arrival time in the B<view_available_fleets>
call assumes that the fleet will be travelling at top speed from the 
instant at which the call was made. Make allowance when setting the
arrival time for the delay between that call and this one.

The B<second> can only be one of '00', '15', '30', or '45'.

Throws 1002, 1009, 1010, 1016.

The response returns the details about the single fleet that was sent, including confirmation of
it's arrival time.


=head2 recall_fleet

Recall all, or part of a fleet, back to it's body of origin.

Recalling an orbiting Spy Shuttle also fetches as many idle spies as will fit from the planet it was orbiting.

Throws 1002, 1010, 1013.

Accepts either fixed arguments or a hash of named parameters

 ( session_id, fleet_id, quantity )
 ( parameter_hash )
  
=head3 session_id (required)
  
A session ID
  
=head3 fleet_id (required)

The ID of the fleet to send

=head3 quantity (required)

The number of ships in the fleet to recall

=head3 RESPONSE

Returns the same as B<view>


=head2 recall_all

This API call is no longer supported since it will indiscriminately recall all ships, Orbiting, Defending or
Travelling.


=head2 rename_fleet

Change the name for a number of ships in a fleet

Accepts either fixed arguments or a hash of named parameters

 ( session_id, building_id, fleet_id, name )
 ( parameter_hash )

=head3 session_id (required)

A session ID

=head3 building_id (required)

The unique id for the space port.

=head3 fleet_id (required)

The unique id of the fleet you want to name.

=head3 name (required)

The name you want to give the ship. 1 to 30 characters. No profanity. No funky characters.

=head3 quantity (optional)

The number of ships in the fleet you want to rename, defaults to all ships.

Note. this argument is only available for the named parameter calling method

If you specify a quantity less than the number of ships currently in the fleet then that
number of ships will be split off to form a new fleet with the new name. The original fleet
will retain it's original name but with a reduced number of ships.

Note also that if either fleet matches an existing fleet in all respects (attributes, task,
start/available time) then such fleets will be merged into a single fleet with the combined
quantity.

This gives you a means of creating or merging fleets of ships with the same attributes, just
give them different names. However, it will be much easier to manage fleets if you don't
split them in this way but allow the system to split and merge fleets based on their tasks.

=head3 RESPONSE

Returns the same response as B<view>


=head2 scuttle_fleet

Destroy ships from a fleet that you no longer need. You can only scuttle ships
that report the B<can_scuttle> status of '1'.

Accepts either fixed arguments or a hash of named parameters

 ( session_id, building_id, fleet_id, quantity )
 ( parameter_hash )

=head3 session_id (required)

A session ID

=head3 building_id (required)

This buildings ID

=head3 fleet_id (required)

The ID of the fleet to be scuttled.

=head3 quantity (required)

The number of ships in the fleet to be scuttled.

If you specify a quantity less than the number of ships currently in the fleet then the fleet
will be reduced by that amount. If you specify the total number of ships then the whole fleet
will be destroyed.

=head3 RESPONSE

Returns the same response as B<view>


 
=head2 view_travelling_fleets

Returns a list of all ships based at this colony that are currently travelling.

B<NOTE:> Only a certain number of spies can fit in each type of ship. Spy Pods can hold 1. Spy Shuttles can hold 4. 
and ships with a cargo hold can hold 1 for every 350 units of hold size. Note however that a fleet of (say) 10 spy pods
can hold 10 spies.
