=head1 Planetary Command Methods

Planetary Command Center is accessible via the URL C</planetarycommand>.

The Planetary Command Center (PCC), or just Command, is the hub of your empire on a planet. It gives you the resources and storage you need to get a foothold on a planet.

The list of methods below represents changes and additions to the methods that all L<Buildings> share.

=head2 view ( session_id, building_id )

Command extends the view method to include a C<planet> section.

 {
    "building" : { ... },
    "status" : { ... },
    "next_colony_cost" : 750000,        # the amount of happiness required to settle your next colony
    "food" : {
      "algae_hour" : 24,
      "algae_stored" :1322,
      "bean_hour" : 1,
      "bean_stored" :42,
      ..
    },
    "ore" : {
      "anthracite_hour" : 333,
      "anthracite_stored" : 34444,
      "bauxite_hour" : 22,
      "bauxite_stored" : 1235,
      ...
    },
    "pod_delay" : 70515,  # seconds between supply pod sendings
    "planet" : {
        "id" : "id-goes-here",
        "x" : -4,
        "y" : 10,
        "z" : 6,
        "star_id" : "id-goes-here",
        "orbit" : 3,
        "type" : "habitable planet",
        "name" : "Earth",
        "image" : "p13",
        "size" : 67,
        "water" : 900,
        "ore" : {
            "gold" : 3399,
            "bauxite" : 4000,
            ...
        },
        "building_count" : 7,
        "population" : 470000,
        "happiness" : 3939,
        "happiness_hour" : 25,
        "food_stored" : 33329,
        "food_capacity" : 40000,
        "food_hour" : 229,
        "energy_stored" : 39931,
        "energy_capacity" : 43000,
        "energy_hour" : 391,
        "ore_hour" 284,
        "ore_capacity" 35000,
        "ore_stored" 1901,
        "waste_hour" : 933,
        "waste_stored" : 9933,
        "waste_capacity" : 13000,
        "water_stored" : 9929,
        "water_hour" : 295,
        "water_capacity" : 51050
    }
 }


=head2 view_plans ( session_id, building_id )

Returns a list of all the plans you've collected through various means.

 {
    "status" : { ... },
    "plans" : [
        {
           "quantity" : 23,
           "name" : "Malcud Fungus Farm",
           "level" : 1,
           "extra_build_level" : 5
        },
        ...
    ]
 }

If the C<level> is 1, and there is an C<extra_build_level>, that means that the building will be built up to 1 plus the extra build level when complete. So in the example above, it would be a level 6 directly after being built.


=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 building_id

The unique id of the PCC.


=head2 view_incoming_supply_chains ( session_id, building_id )

Returns a list of all incoming supply chains feeding this planet.

 {
    "status" : { ... },
    "supply_chains" : [
        {
            "id" : "id-goes-here",
            "from_body" : {
              "id" : "id-goes-here",
              "name" : "Mars",
              "x" : 0,
              "y" : -123,
              "image" : "station"
            },
            "resource_hour" : 10000000,
            "resource_type" : 'water',
            "percent_transferred" : 95,
            "stalled" : 0,
        },
        ...
    ]
 }
