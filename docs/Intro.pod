=head1 Introduction

This document can introduce you to interacting with the Lacuna Expanse game server. 

=head1 SERVERS

The list of playable servers can be read from L<http://www.lacunaexpanse.com/servers.json>.

 [
  {
   "name" : "NA1",
   "uri" : "https://na1.lacunaexpanse.com/",
   "status" : "Open",
   "location" : "United States"
  }
  ...
 ]

Each server in this list is an instance of the game, an individual universe separated from the others. Your app will need to allow users to select which server they want to interact with form this list.

=head1 JSON-RPC

The Lacuna Expanse uses a JSON-RPC 2.0 based API. You can read more about JSON-RPC 2.0 at L<http://groups.google.com/group/json-rpc/web/json-rpc-2-0>.

You can access these methods either as HTTP POSTs or GETs. 

=head2 HTTP GET

Many of the methods can be accessed using an HTTP GET request. Here's an example URL:

 https://game.lacunaexpanse.com/empire?jsonrpc=2.0&id=1&method=is_name_available&params=["Lacuna Expanse Corp"]

The C<https://game.lacunaexpanse.com/> part gets you to the server.

Then C</empire> lets you interact with the L<Empire> module. See below for a complete list.

To make it JSON-RPC 2.0 compatible, you must include the C<jsonrpc=2.0&id=1> part.

Then specify the method you wish to call with C<method=is_name_available>. 

And finally pass in whatever parameters you need like C<params=["Lacuna Expanse Corp"]>. Parameters need to be encoded in JSON. By default all methods require an array of parameters. However, some will specifically request a hash reference of parameters; that would look like C<params={"this":"that","foo":"bar"}>

B<NOTE:> You must URL encode the params. If you don't, you'll get a parse error from the server.

=head2 HTTP POST

Most programming languages will have a JSON-RPC 2.0 client you can either use directly, or download from the internet. These will use HTTP POST. If you need to manually create a POST, it would look like:

 POST,https://game.lacunaexpanse.com/species
 {
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"is_name_available",
    "params":["Human"]
 }

B<NOTE:> It's important to make the distinction here that when you're sending a POST, you're not sending URL parameters. You're sending a full POST body. If you format it with parameters like a GET request you'll get a parse error in response.

=head3 Use Post When Possible

HTTP POST is the preferred method of execution. The reasons for this are:

=over

=item *

You can make multiple method calls in the same request, per the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification.

=item *

Depending upon the HTTP Client, you'll have somewhere between 512 and 2048 bytes to send the request on a GET, but it can be unlimited on a POST. 

=item * 

If you use an HTTP GET, you'll need to URL Encode the params, but with POST you don't need to do that.

=back

=head2 Response

Either way you'll get a response back with either a result or an error message.

=head3 Result

If you make a successful request you'll get a response like:

 { 
    "jsonrpc" : "2.0", 
    "id" : 1, 
    "result" : 0 
 }

=head3 Error

If an exception is thrown you'll get an error response. It's a hash containing a code, message, and data section.

 { 
    "jsonrpc" : "2.0", 
    "id" : 1, 
    "error" : {
        "code" : 1000, 
        "message" : "Name not available.", 
        "data" : null
    } 
 }

B<NOTE:> If you get a JSON-RPC error, then the web server will also give you a 500 HTTP error code. 

=head2 Named parameter requests

Starting in Version 4.000 of the server code, named arguments have been introduced. Where possible the original 
positional argument calling method has been retained, but this is now deprecated. Future enhancement to methods
will only be supported in the named argument methods.

As an example, the following is a call to the shipyard API to find out what fleets are buildable
using both the original positional arguments and the new named argument calling conventions.

Both of these will return the same results.

=head3 original positional calling convention

 {
   "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
   "id" : 1,
   "method" : "get_buildable",
   "params" : [
     "329da49c-7e88-4897-9d8c-3e5f6309d9b7",
     "127894",
     "Trade",
   ]
 }

This method has the advantage that it is slightly more consise, the disadvantage is that
it is less flexible to expansion and with large numbers of parameters difficult to remember
what each parameter represents.

Although this convention will be retained for now, any future additions to methods (which
require additional parameters) will not be supported by this calling convention.

=head3 new named argument calling convention

 {
   "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
   "id" : 1,
   "method" : "get_buildable",
   "params" : [{
     "session_id" : "329da49c-7e88-4897-9d8c-3e5f6309d9b7",
     "tag" : "Trade",
     "building_id" : "127894"
   }]
 }

This is the preferred calling convention, parameters are named and can be in any order,
if a parameter is optional, then just don't include it. This convention allows future
enhancements to methods without breaking backwards compatibility or having long lists
of fixed place arguments.

If an API states that it can use 'a hash of named parameters' then it supports the new
calling convention.

Over time it is hoped that all API calls will support the new convention.

=head2 RPC Limit

You may only make a number of calls up to the RPC Limit in a given 24 hour period. The current limit is 10,000. They are also rate limited to 75 calls per minute. The counter resets roughly (give or take 60 minutes) at midnight GMT. Your RPC calls are counted across all clients you use and your own programs.

If you find yourself needing more RPC calls than the limit allows then you are likely making a lot of redundant requests. For example body.get_buildings() returns the entire list of buildings, and a time as to when their stats will change. So instead of calling every building on every planet every time your program looks something up, cache it until it changes.



=head1 Status

Most methods will provide a status block as part of the response. This is used to update 
the user interface and alert the user to things. The status block looks like this:

 {
   ...
   "status" : {
     "server" : {
       "time" : "01 31 2010 13:09:05 +0600",
       "version" : 2.0604,
       "announcement" : 1, # see the Announcement API
       "rpc_limit" : 2500, # max calls per day, compare to empire rpc_count
       "star_map_size" : {
         "x" : [ -15, 15 ],
         "y" : [ -15, 15 ],
         "z" : [ -15, 15 ]
        }
      },
      "empire" : { # this block is not always included
        See get_status() in Empire
      },
      "body" : { # this block is not always included
        See get_status() in Body
      }
   }
 }

Methods using the 'hash of named parameters' method can specify a 'no_status : 1' argument
which will inhibit the return of a status block. This can be slightly more efficient for those
cases where you don't care to check the status.
